description: We’re launching 25 Days of Serverless as a way for you to explore – any way you like – the promise and potential of serverless technologies. Over the month of December, you’ll be able to tackle all kinds of challenges that you can solve any way you like; we’ll offer solutions built on Azure, of course, but we’re curious how you would approach the problems we will present to you.
