    <p>Welcome! I'm Jen Looper, Head of Academic Advocacy at AWS. I have over 23 years' experience as a web and mobile developer, specializing in creating cross-platform apps, often with an educational focus. I design excellent curriculum on technical topics and am known for the quality of my educational content.</p>
    <p>I'm a multilingual multiculturalist with a passion for hardware hacking, mobile apps, the frontend of the web and various JavaScript frameworks and meta-frameworks, applied machine learning and AI (as well as the ramifications!) and discovering new things every day.</p>
    <p>I'm also an author of a textbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Kids-Storytelling-Approach/dp/1119912512/">Computer Science for Kids: A Storytelling Approach</a> for grades 6-8, aligned to CSTA standards. Learn more about this textbook at <a href="https://cs4kids.club">CS4Kids.club</a>.</p>
    <p>I also wrote The Illustrated AWS Cloud, also with Wiley, a visual guide to learning fundamental concepts of Cloud computing with AWS. Learn more at <a href="https://illustratedaws.cloud">The Illustrated AWS Cloud web site</a>.</p>
    <p>In 2018 I founded what became an international nonprofit organization, Front-End Foxes, Inc. Our mission was to educate women worldwide in front-end web and mobile technologies. During the pandemic we pivoted to become a free bootcamp for women. I'm very proud of what we accomplished over five years.</p>
